# Hands-On AI App
## ðŸ’¡ Idea
Hands-On AI is an app that contains basic information about Artificial Intelligence. The idea came from the univeristy class that I was taking. Even if this topic is not directly related to my studies, I found AI really intresting and I would like to pass this knowledge on to other people in a fun, easy way in the form of an app.
